# LangChain Projects – LLM-Powered Applications

This repository contains a collection of hands-on projects built using **LangChain**, **Streamlit**, and **LLMs** (e.g., OpenAI, Ollama). These demos cover core concepts like prompt chains, chat interfaces, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), making it a practical reference for anyone working on modern LLM-based applications.
